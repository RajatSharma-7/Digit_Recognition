**Digit Recognition Readme**

This project is a Handwritten Digit Recognition system built using Deep Learning. The application allows users to draw digits on a screen, and a trained neural network model predicts the digit. The project is implemented using Python, Pygame, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras.

Features

User can draw a digit on the screen using the mouse.

The model predicts the digit in real-time.

Uses a pre-trained CNN model to recognize digits from 0 to 9.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Pygame.

Supports clearing the screen for new input.

Technologies Used

Python (Programming Language)

TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning Framework)

Pygame (GUI for Drawing Digits)

OpenCV (Image Processing)

NumPy (Array Manipulation)
